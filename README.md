# Covid-19-API
I have developed an API wrapper for the public API hosted on  https://covidapi.info upon the dataset of John Hopkins University in CSV form which was converted to JSON Time Series format by pomber. This project intends to make it easy for one to grab the data in python for their own data consumption. Feel free to clone it and use it.
